<p>Is there any soup better than chicken gnocchi? Honestly one of my favorites by far!<br>
On second thought it might actually be my favorite. Although I bet you've always wondered what gnocchi is.<br>
You're not alone! Gnocchi is mostly made of potato and contains flour and eggs.<br>
You can find it in the pasta aisle in mostly any grocery store.<br>
All right, all right enough with the boring stuff. Let's make it!</p>
<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>1 small yellow onion(diced)</li>
    <li>1 stick of celery(diced)</li>
    <li>1/2 cup carrots(squared)</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves(minced)</li>
    <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>2 cups half-and-half</li>
    <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
    <li>1 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>

</ul>

<h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Add the diced onions, celery, and carrots and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute.</li> 
    <li>Add the flour and stir to combine. Cook for 2 minutes, until the flour begins to turn a golden color.</li>
    <li>Add the chicken broth and half and half in splashes, stirring to incorporate. Donâ€™t add it too quickly or you will break the roux.</li>
    <li>Add the thyme and mustard powder.</li>
    <li>If using uncooked chicken, add it to the broth. Bring it to a gentle boil. (If you boil too rapidly, the chicken will become tough.) Simmer until the chicken is cooked through, about 10 minutes. (This depends on the thickness of the chicken.)</li>
    <li>Remove the chicken and let it rest for 5 minutes, then dice it and add it back to the soup. Let the soup simmer until desired consistency is obtained, it will continue to thicken.</li>
    <li>Add the gnocchi and simmer for about 5 minutes, refer to package instructions for exact amount of time.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat to low and add the spinach, red pepper flakes, and any salt/pepper to taste. Simmer until spinach is wilted, about 1 minute. Serve!</li>
